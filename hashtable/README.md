# a test project implements a hash table in the following ways:
1. the HTA class implements a hashtable with open addressing AKA closed hashing
   a probe sequences is Linear probing
2. the HT class implements a hashtable with separate chaining
   a probe sequences is Linear probing

# run
mvn test
